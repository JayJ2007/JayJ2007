# 👋 Hi, I'm Jay Joshi

I’m an engineering student with a strong interest in how computing systems work at a fundamental level — from digital logic and silicon to operating systems, networks, and large-scale systems. I enjoy working close to the hardware, asking first-principles questions, and building a solid understanding of complex systems.
